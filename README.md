### Color-Picker Application

This application lets you explore different color palettes from various frameworks and libraries. Copy the colors by simply clicking on them. Colors can easily be converted between hex, rgb, and rgba formats. The hue of the entire palette can also be controlled with the help of the level slider.

The user can also create his own color palette of maximum 20 colors. The colors must be unique with a unique name. If out of ideas, the user can take inspiration for generating new colors by using the random color button. The new palette will be stored in the local storage along with the previous palettes for future use.

Enjoy! ðŸ’¯
